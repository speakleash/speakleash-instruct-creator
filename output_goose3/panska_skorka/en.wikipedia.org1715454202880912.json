{"meta_description": "", "title": "Pańska skórka - Wikipedia", "content": "Pańska skórka (pl: Lord's leather or lord's skin, depending on the translation) is a traditional homemade candy, wrapped in parchment paper and sold mainly in and around Warsaw. The candy is made of sugar, water, syrup, egg whites whipped with a pinch of salt, gelatin, some kind of flavoring, pink fruit juice (usually raspberry) and potato flour.[1] After the batter is cooked, it is poured onto a flat sheet and, after cooling down, cut into squares about 3 cm wide. Pańska skórka is most often very sweet, with a delicate caramel-almond flavor, if made with the traditional recipe in mind. It is usually white and pink, although nowadays a variety and flavors and corresponding colors can be purchased, including for example cola or bubble gum.[2] According to one of the many origin stories, the confectionery was invented in 19th century in Praga district. The following recipe was provided by the historic records: \"Of the purest gum arabic, pour half a pound of spring or river water into a saucepan and cook over high heat until it dissolves, and when it is dissolved, strain through a flannel, and when it has completely cooled, add a pound of finely ground sugar and put it on the coals, cook slowly, as it starts to steam from the boiler, the mass will thicken, mix quickly, add a little foam from 8 egg whites, beat so that it is not too heavy, then remove from the heat and immediately put into paper molds [covered] in vegetable oil or the best olive oil. Pour again almond oil or olive oil on top and store in jars\".[3] The candy is sold at the capital's cemeteries on November 1, All Saints' Day. In 2008, it was entered on the list of traditional products in the Masovian Voivodeship.[4] A comparable candy, known as trupi miodek (corpse honey), is sold in and around Kraków.[5] The confectionery is usually made as a cottage industry product, and some Varsovians shun it as possibly cooked in unhygienic conditions.[6] Pańska skórka was called panieńska skórka (maiden's leather/skin) at the beginning of the 20th century, as featured in Słownik warszawski (Dictionary of Warsaw). The confectionery was then described as a \"sweet mallow cake, sold in bars in pharmacies, as a cough remedy or as a delicacy\"[4] (1908 edition), while in the 1915 edition the candy seems to be \"a pharmacy product, rather a delicacy than a medicine, given to coughing children, and composed of gum arabic, fine sugar, egg white, all beaten into foam, with orange flower oil, which forms quadrangular tablets, dried in moderate heat.\"", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pa%C5%84ska_sk%C3%B3rka", "category": "mazowieckie", "sub_category": "Wyroby piekarnicze i cukiernicze", "phrase": "Pańska skórka"}
