{"meta_description": "", "title": "Kaszanka - Wikipedia", "content": "Kaszanka is a traditional blood sausage in Central and Eastern European cuisine. It is made of a mixture of pig's blood, pork offal (commonly liver), and buckwheat (kasha) or barley stuffed in a pig intestine. It is usually flavored with onion, black pepper, and marjoram. The dish likely originates in Germany or Denmark.[1] Kaszanka may be eaten cold, but traditionally it is either grilled or fried with onions and then served with potato and sauerkraut. • krupńok; krupniok (more of a slight name difference than variation; Silesia) • żymlok (a variation of Krupniok based on cut bread roll instead of buckwheat; Silesia) • Maischel (Carinthia, Austria): Grützwurst without blood and not cased in intestine but worked into balls in caul fat. The name comes from the Slovenian majželj, in turn derived from the Bavarian Maisen (\"slices\").[2]", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaszanka", "category": "łódzkie", "sub_category": "Mięso świeże oraz produkty mięsne", "phrase": "Kaszanka"}
