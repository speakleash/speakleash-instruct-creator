Stuffed with meat, twaróg or mushroom stuffing, alternatively served without stuffing, and instead served with bacon, lard or fried onion. Leavened pyzy or pyzy drożdżowe are prepared from flour, eggs, yeast, milk, butter, sugar and salt.[3] These are cooked in boiling water or on steam (see pampuchy).[3] In literature, pyzy are said to also be prepared by being baked in an oven.[3]", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyzy_(dish)", "category": "pomorskie", "sub_category": "Gotowe dania i potrawy", "phrase": "Pyzy borowiackie"}
