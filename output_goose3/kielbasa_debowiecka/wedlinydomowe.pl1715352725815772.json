{"meta_description": "", "title": "Kielbasa debowiecka & szynkowa - Homemade Sausage Making", "content": "Using Marianski's recipes as my guide, I made both these sausages last week. For Class I meat, I used pork loin. I was pleased with the results because everyone loved these sausages but I'm often guilty of splitting hairs at times and think next time I will either use some ham in the mix to give them more eye appeal from the rosier color I can get from the ham versus loin. I think a 50/50 mix of the two would be interesting. However, this is just splitting hairs because these are really good as is. Of course, I could also follow the recipe to the letter and not try and please my wife and I would have had more color in the sausage but it is what it is.Anyhow, I started by cubing the lean loin and curing the cubed it for 3 days then made the emulsions. Since I was trying to make a low fat sausage (for my wife) I changed the recipe for the debowiecka recipe and omitted the 30% pork butt meat which I'm sure affected the color while pleasing the sweet smelling one and her delicate palette.Nonetheless, all was good in the end.Mince in stufferHung sausages for a few hours before smokingSmoked in pecan smoke - beautiful color I thoughtFinishedFinished", "url": "https://wedlinydomowe.pl/en/viewtopic.php?t=9636", "category": "podkarpackie", "sub_category": "Mięso świeże oraz produkty mięsne", "phrase": "Kiełbasa dębowiecka"}
