{"meta_description": "", "title": "Sława - Wikipedia", "content": "Sława [ˈswava] is a town in Wschowa County, Lubusz Voivodeship, in western Poland, with 4,321 inhabitants (2019). It is situated on the eastern shore of Lake Sławskie. The area was part of Poland after the creation of the state in the 10th century. Later on, as a result of the fragmentation of Poland into smaller provincial duchies, Sława initially formed part of Greater Poland before it passed to Silesia,[2] and then to the Duchy of Głogów, where it remained ruled by the Piast dynasty until 1468. The town was mentioned in a document from 1312. Between 1871 and 1945 the town was part of Germany under the Germanized name Schlawa. In 1937 it was renamed Schlesiersee during the Nazi campaign of erasing placenames of Polish origin.[3] During World War II, the Germans operated a women's subcamp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp in the town.[4] On 21 January 1945 the camp was dissolved and the surviving prisoners were sent on a death march towards Zielona Góra.[4] The original Polish name Sława was restored after Nazi Germany's defeat in the war, when the town once again became part of Poland. The Sława municipality is known for poultry farming and production. The officially protected traditional foods, as designated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Poland, are the turkey kiełbasa myśliwska and kiełbasa sucha, and the pork and turkey kiełbasa sławska z indykiem, kiełbasa podsuszana sławska z indykiem, kiełbasa szynkowa sławska z indykiem and serdelki sławskie z indykiem, all types of kiełbasa, plus the turkey polędwica.[5][6][7][8][9][10][11] Apart from meat products, the Sława butter (Masło sławskie) is also a designated traditional food.[12]", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C5%82awa", "category": "lubuskie", "sub_category": "Mięso świeże oraz produkty mięsne", "phrase": "Serdelki sławskie z indykiem"}
