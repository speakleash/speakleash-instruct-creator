{"meta_description": "It’s not clear whether Poland owes its gołąbki to Turkish, Armenian or Jewish influences. They were apparently first served in the Eastern borderlands. A 19th century cook books speak of “stuffed cabbage”.", "title": "Polish Food 101 ‒ Gołąbki", "content": "A rich variety of gołąbki possibilities is to be found in old cook books and regional traditions. One of the typical Eastern borderland versions has the stuffing wrapped in pickled cabbage leaves from cabbage heads previously soured in their entirety, without chopping. The author of a popular early 20th century Uniwersalna książka kucharska (Universal Cook Book), Maria Ochorowicz - Monatowa, called this variety “ruskie” (from the historic name of Red Ruthenia, or Red Russina, also inhabited by Polish people) – \"Real Ruskie gołąbki are made from sour cabbage, which has to be pickled as a whole cabbage head. Two such heads should be peeled into each separate leaf and the stuffing should be rolled in them as previously. They ought to simmer not on sour rye bortsch, as that would make them too sour, but on a delicate mushroom flavour.\" These Ruskie gołąbki were also called “hołupcie”. They are known in today’s Karpaty region and appear in recipes of the Łemko ethnic minority, who call them “kiszeniaki” and stuff them with groats and meat. The Polish Ministry of Agriculture actually lists a recipe from Nowe Sioło on its official list of regional products. The formerly Polish city of Lviv also used to serve the gołąbki with grated potatoes. The Eastern influences are also present in the Lower Silesia region. In 1945, many people from the Eastern Borderlands region were made to resettle there, and they brought their ancestors’ culinary traditions with them. Among them is the buckwheat groats, potato and meat gołąbki recipe. A vegetarian version of the dish was served for Christmas Eve. Nowadays gołąbki are usually simmered in meat or mushroom broth, but 100 years ago they used to be baked in a layer of sour rye soup, or cabbage leaven or whey. This method is rather specialized, but it is still used by the family of this text’s author. It’s also worth pointing out that it isn’t only white cabbage that can be used to make the gołąbki, but also its delicate Italian kind, or even red cabbage. The stuffing can be made not only with pork meat and rice, but also other kinds of meat, and the distinctively Eastern European groat variety called kasza [pronounced: KA-shah].", "url": "https://culture.pl/en/work/polish-food-101-golabki", "category": "podkarpackie", "sub_category": "Gotowe dania i potrawy", "phrase": "Gołąbki z Nowego Sioła"}
