Chosen products Masło Extra Łowickie (A) and Osełka z Bychawy...", "content": "Despite the World Health Organization (WHO) advocating a healthy and balanced diet for consumers for many years, inadequate fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption remains a substantial issue with economic, social, environmental, and nutritional implications. This study aims to identify consumer profiles for sustainable fruit and vegetable consumption in the European Union, considering specific demographic and socio-economic factors. The analysis is based on data from the 2019 European Health Interview Survey (EHIS). This article provides a clear understanding of how gender, age, education level, income, and place of residence relate to sustainable FV consumption through a principal component analysis (PCA). By defining consumer profiles linked to sustainable and healthy FV consumption, the study aids in creating cohesive goals for promoting health within European society. The results of the PCA reveal four distinct consumer profiles and enhance our understanding of the factors influencing these profiles. These findings align with previous research, indicating that consumer profiles remain relatively consistent. According to the PCA classification, sustainable fruit and vegetable consumption is more prevalent among women, educated individuals, higher-income consumers, and those over 55 years old. In contrast, the opposite profile consists of consumers with lower income, younger and middle-aged individuals, men, and those with less than a high school education, highlighting the need for effective strategies to promote a healthier diet in this group. Countries with lower economic development, reflected in consumer incomes, deviate the most from the recommended “at least five portions of fruit and vegetables a day” consumption pattern, and do not exhibit a sustainable consumption model. Thus, continued monitoring of consumer profiles is essential, with a focus on both the quantity and frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption, as well as strategies aiming to increase their intake.", "url": "https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Chosen-products-Maslo-Extra-Lowickie-A-and-Oselka-z-Bychawy-B-Source-Product-websites_fig2_367404098", "category": "lubelskie", "sub_category": "Oleje i tłuszcze (masło, margaryna itp.)", "phrase": "Masło z Bychawy"}
