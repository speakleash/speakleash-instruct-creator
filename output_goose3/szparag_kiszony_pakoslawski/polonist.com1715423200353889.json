Wielkopolska (Greater Poland) is renowned for its excellent asparagus. Its cultivation in this region dates back to the 19th century. During the Prussian partition, German settlers established their farms here and brought white, green and purple stalks along with them. (source in Polish) With time, Polish farmers took over these crops, continuing their production. To extend the scandalously short asparagus season, they started fermenting them – the same way as other fruit and veggies, most notably, cucumbers. In the village of Pakosław (southern Wielkopolska), the traditional fermentation process involves a salty brine with the addition of oak leaves, horseradish root, garlic and fresh dill. Once soured, asparagus keeps its wonderful colour, crispness and firmness. If you would like to visit the village and taste the ‘real deal’, visit Wojciechówka farm, renowned for its fermented asparagus.
