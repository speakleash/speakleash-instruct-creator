{"meta_description": "", "title": "Mazurskie Miody – Bring The Rocks", "content": "In 1964 Witold Bogdan Piasecki established the first bee farm Mazurkie Miody. He is very passionate about the work of beekeeping and at the same time is committed to preserving the family traditions. He has also spent several years exploring the mysteries behind the composition of nectar. The enthusiasm for this work in the exploration of the possibility of the use of honey was relatively born. The company was established in Olsztyn, Poland, which was the original honey collection site. In January 2002, Mazurskie Miody obtained ISO9001 certification for quality management by the International Organization for Standardization, and was also the first company in Poland to develop honey desserts. For the Piasecki family, winemaking is a family tradition that has been passed down for generations. However, apart from Mr. Bogdan Piasecki, no other family members want to produce alcoholic beverages on a large scale. The most popular in his family is brewing Dwojniak (double) mead. A truly good mead not only requires a careful fermentation process, it is also very important to enrich the drink with a unique taste of roots, herbs and spices. All meads are made of these raw materials with different ingredients, but the only difference is that Piasecki’s family secret recipe is based on the wine spectrum created by ancestors. Mead is not the only alcoholic beverage with passion for Mr. Piasecki. Honey-based liqueur is also a common drink for family celebration parties. Mrs. Ewa Urbanska (the head of the laboratory department) has produced a unique and beautiful wine with the knowledge of distillation, raw material composition and professionalism. At the same time, a breakthrough production process was carried out in Piasecki. This is the first time in Polish history that mead is produced without heat treatment. So it can retain all the nutrients in honey. At that time, no other brewer had the same technology to produce on a large scale. To this day, Mr. Piasecki still strives to expand the selection of his beverage line, or share more new ideas to the public, and these are all based on the long-standing Polish tradition of producing honey and honey-based products.", "url": "https://bringtherocks.com/en/%E7%91%AA%E8%B1%8E%E7%AB%8B%E9%9B%85%E8%9C%82%E8%9C%9C/", "category": "warmińsko-mazurskie", "sub_category": "Napoje (alkoholowe i bezalkoholowe) ", "phrase": "Okowita miodowa warmińska"}
