{"meta_description": "Main aim of this research was to trace the development of volatile profile of Kumpiak podlaski dry‐cured ham during traditional curing and ripening for 30 weeks. Volatiles were extracted from each 6‐week period of ripening, and overall fifty‐three aroma compounds were identified. Changes in chemical groups share between cured and fully ripened ham were observed: aldehydes (35.49 → 31.37%), ketones (25.18 → 14.62%), alcohols (17.97 → 15.74%), esters (3.37 → 12.04%), hydrocarbons (7.69 → 6.81%), fatty acids (0.02 → 0.53%), terpenes (2.26 → 9.70%) and heterocyclic aromatic compounds (0.99 → 0.78%). The 18th week of ripening is crucial for the aroma of Kumpiak podlaski ham due to start of continuous decrease in ketones and increase in esters’ and terpenes’ share. Formation of esters and terpenes originated from the presence of local herbs and the development of microflora. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed clear separation of samples from each 6‐week period of ripening. Obtained results relying on thirty‐seven compounds enabled to make a preliminary determination of ripening markers.", "title": "Publication – Development of volatile profile of Kumpiak podlaski dry‐cured ham during traditional ripening – Warsaw University of Life Sciences - SGGW", "content": "Main aim of this research was to trace the development of volatile profile of Kumpiak podlaski dry‐cured ham during traditional curing and ripening for 30 weeks.
