The origin of this Polish sausage is Tuchoów, the city with long tradition in making quality sausages. It lies about 80 km (50 miles) from Krakow, at the foothills of Carpathian Mountains (Karpaty). • None Using food processor emulsify half of ground beef (100 g) adding 30-35% (30 ml, 1 oz fl) crushed ice or cold water. Add cure #1 and spices at this stage. • None Adding salt mix remaining half of beef with pork until sticky. Add fat and emulsified meat and mix everything together. • None Stuff into 36 mm or larger hog casings. Form straight links 30-40” (80-100 cm) long, both ends tied with twine. Sausages hung on smoke sticks in the middle on themselves. • None Hang for 12 hours at 2-6° C (35-43° F) OR dry for 2-3 hours at room temperature. This is an optional conditioning step that provides more time for sodium nitrite (cure #1) to develop strong color and curing flavor. • None Apply hot smoke for 120-140 min, then bake sausages at 80-85° C (176-185° F) for 30 - 45 minutes. Total time 150-170 min until sausages reach 68-70° C (154-158° F) internal temperature and casings develop brown color. • None Cool in air to 18° C (64° F) or lower. The sausage is ready to eat. • None Apply cold smoke at 18° C (68° F) for about 12 hours or warm smoke (24-32° C, 75-90° F) for about 6 hours until dark brown color is obtained. This smoking step was performed in the past to remove more moisture in order to develop a semi-dry sausage that will last longer at room temperature. • None Cool sausages in air to 18° C (64° F) or lower.", "url": "https://www.meatsandsausages.com/sausage-recipes/cooked/polish/tuchowska", "category": "małopolskie", "sub_category": "Mięso świeże oraz produkty mięsne", "phrase": "Kiełbasa tuchowska"}
