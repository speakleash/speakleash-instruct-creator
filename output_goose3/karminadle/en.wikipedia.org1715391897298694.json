When served with potato pureé, kasza or rice, they constitute a traditional Upper Silesian karminadle.[1] Generally, karminadle are small, round and often flattened cutlets made from pork or a combination of pork and beef, although more commonly historically from rabbit meat, due to the ongoing rabbit breeding tradition in Upper Silesia. Karminadle used to be a holiday-only dish, but it is now an everyday, all-year food item.[2] Karminadle, sliced in half, may be served cold on bread or bread rolls.[3][4]", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karminadle", "category": "śląskie", "sub_category": "Gotowe dania i potrawy", "phrase": "Karminadle / karbinadle / kardinadle"}
