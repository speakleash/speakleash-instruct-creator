{"meta_description": "", "title": "FriendSheep", "content": "I have to tell you something! *^o^*Last week we wrote a big Japanese test covering the material from the last two years of studying. I didn't feel too strong but I put some effort and learnt a lot, working through grammar and vocabulary, and... I got the highest score in my group, I passed at 82% ! *^0^*~~~ I'm mostly happy because it turned out that I understand and know the grammar quite well, and I know how to use it. Now I need a lot of practice and speaking, which is the next level programme I've already started, I'm not at the intermediate course. ^^*~~", "url": "http://www.friendsheep.com/2013/11/", "category": "pomorskie", "sub_category": "Mięso świeże oraz produkty mięsne", "phrase": "Szynka z kołnierzykiem "}
