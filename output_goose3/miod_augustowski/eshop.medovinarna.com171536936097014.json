Augustowski Późny is made from honey harvested in July and August, when, in addition to nectar from swamps and forests, bees brought honeydew and buckwheat nectar from fields between forests. Enjoy slowly. Suitable for lovers of strong tastes. Mead is an alcoholic beverage fermented from honey and water, with possibility of addition of other ingredients such as spices or herbs or in combination with fruit juices. Classical mead is made by fermenting honey and water without any other ingrediences. It keeps its original honey flavour and taste. This mead was made cold. This means that during its production, the honey was not heated above 40-45 °C, which is the normal temperature in nature to which honey is resistant. At higher temperatures, some precious components of honey can be damaged and degraded. Cold-made mead is the best choice. The mead was awarded a gold medal at the Mazer Cup 2020 and Mead Madness Cup 2020. Founders Piotr Piłasiewicz and Paweł Kotwica decided to reborn mead production in north-eastern Poland based on the traditions of the Polish-Lithuanian region.
