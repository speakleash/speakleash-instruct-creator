The analysis of those names points at the difficulties an etymologist or a dialectal lexicographer have to face in order to show the route of the wordfrom the source language to the target language. It also clearly shows how intertwined the influences of Polish, German, Slovakian, Ukrainian and Hungarian languages are in the south east of Poland.", "url": "https://www.ceeol.com/search/article-detail?id=889194", "category": "podkarpackie", "sub_category": "Wyroby piekarnicze i cukiernicze", "phrase": "Bandurzak"}
