From the point of view of the concept of sustainable development its development is particularly significant since it guarantees income for many agricultural producers, maintains local social bonds and exerts a positive impact on the environment including the biodiversity of agricultural production. The analysis has been performed from the point of view of sustainable development of the sector as well as areas of origin. It may demonstrate a correlation between the dy namics of traditional products and the development of regional markets in Poland (Kułyk, promotion and interest in the market among consumers has undoubtedly become an opportunity supporting survival and development for many subjects of the agricultural business. Numerous rural producers faces serious difficulty in access to the markets in order to sell their products. The demand for high quality products is increasing. All this means more opportunities for small producers. Better access to national and in ternat ional markets allows them to sell more and better quality products inn higher prices ( Brunori et al., 2016). This in turn encourages farmers to invest into their own enterprises and increase the amount, quality and variety of m anufactu red products the aim of the paper is identification and structurin g of traditional food products in the Lubuskie region. For this purpose the analysis of secondary sources as well as systematic analysis of data pr ovided by the Ministry of agriculture and Rural Development from the THE GEN ESIS AND LEGA L BASIS OF THE FUNCTIONAING OF THE Regional products, often described as are agricultural and food products which come from particular regions and are characterized by much higher quality as well as traditional and exceptional method of production. Their supreme quality is confirmed by specially signs (Ministerstwo Rolnictwa i Rozwoju W si, 2018). Regional products can be registered in the European Committee and the following certificates guaranteeing partly the system of legal protection of regional and traditional products can be granted (Gulbicka, 2014):  Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) – granted to products which come from a particular region. Such product is entirely manuf actured on a given area (including all relevant raw materials). A good example ca n be Po lish cheese from the Podhale area: or a  Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) – granted to products which come from a particular region, yet not the entire process of production must ta ke place there. In order to obtain the certificate on a gi ven area, at least one of the three indicated pr ocesses must take place there i.e. product production, processing or preparation. or are instances of such products (types of bread – rolls) by traditional composition, form production or raw materials used. In this case product certification does not apply to the p lace of origin and signs can be granted to products manufactured in the entire European Union e.g. kiełbasa Regional produ cts constitute also one of the key elements of tou rist promotion in Europe and that is why for the purpose of protec tion the European Union Indications and Traditional Specialties Guaranteed. The system has functioned in Europe since 1992 and in itially was based on the resolution of the EEC Council no. 2081/92 of July 14 1992 on and designations of origin of agricultural and food products the EEC Council no. 2081/92 of July 14 , 19 92 on agricultural and food product.

In 2012, following the repeal of resolutions of March 20 , 2006, the following and currently functioning resolution of the European Parliament and Council no. 11 51/2012 of November 21,2012 on the systems of quality of agricultural and food products. 2013 a resolution delegated to the EU Committee no. 664/2014 of October 18 2013 supplementing the resolution of the European Parliament and Council no. 1 151/2012 in ref erence to the establishment of EU symbols applying to specialties guaranteed as well as several principles applying to the origin of forage and raw materials, an d several procedural regulations as well additional transitional regulations as well as implementin g resolution of the Committee no. implementing resolutions as well as sta ndardizing regulation s and shortening the time of registration of such products (Gulbicka, 2014). Furthermore the EU law include s a resolution delegated to the Committee no. 665/2014 of March 1 1 , 2014 supplementing the re solution of the European Pa rliament and c ouncil no. 1 151/2012 referring to the optionally use quality descriptor ‘mountain product’ which specifies the principle of the use of the term ‘mountain products’ The EU resolutions were implemented in Pol and in 2005 by a Law on registration and protection of names and designations of agricultural and food products as well as traditional products ( At present the fun ctioning of the system is regulated by the Law on and protection of names and designations of agricultural and food products as well as traditional products (Journal of Laws, 2017, point 1 1680 and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development is responsible of the registration of THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MARKET OF TRADITIONAL PR ODUCTS IN THE LUBUSKIE PROV INCE – CHANGES IN THE STRUCTURE OF The first traditional products were registered i n the Lubuskie region in 2006 and they were ‘ (wine) and „Bochen chleba starowiejskiego” (bread) (MRiRW , 20 20). In the initial years of the functioning of the Lubuskie syste m of (alcoholic and non-alhoholic), bakery and confectionary products – and this was the case until 2012.

The market place as a basic element of the in fr astructure of the market of traditional products shorten s the chain of delivery between the producer/farmer and the customer and makes it possible to see, touch and smell products. Considering the current trends for healthy food, it seems to be a perfect place for consumers. That is why investment in market places and infrastructure for sale and promotion of local products is particularly important. In 2018 there were 2156 permanent market places registered by local government units in the state In the years 2007-2020, as part of the Program of Development of Rural Areas , the Lubuskie province received 2 614 954 Euro fo r investment in this area (Rozporządzenie MRiRW , 2013). Thanks to the funds 15 new market places were opened and at the moment there are 41 in the province (Departament …, Woj. Lubuskie, 2020). The geographical all oc ation of market places in the Source: Developed on the basis o f data of the Department of the Development Progarmmes of Rural Areas of Office o f the Marsha l of the Luvuskie Provinc e (as of 19.06.2020), * The market places closed due to COVID-19 pandemia is marked in red. According to the data of the Department of the Development of Rural Areas of the Office of the Marshal of the Lubuskie Province, 20 communes in which there are still no market places are interested in their construction. Considering the fact that the sum of financing for one beneficiary is limited to 250000 Euro (Roz po rządzenie MRiRW, 2013), in order to construct 20 new market places , allocation of means of the European Agricultural Fund for the benefit of the Development of Rural Areas for the Lubuskie Pr ovince would have to be increases by 5000000 Euro. The institutional system of EU protects and promotes traditional products. In this way work of thousands of farmers and food producers is used and contributes to the development and protection of the EU rural h eritage as well as sustainable development in rural area (Guerrero et al., 2009). Furthermore the system guarantees the consumers that they can trust food products marked with this Both regional and na tional markets are not yet saturated with quality traditional products and demonstrates a high potential for growth.
