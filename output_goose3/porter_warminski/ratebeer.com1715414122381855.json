{"meta_description": "", "title": "Kormoran Porter Warminski", "content": "UPDATED: AUG 26, 2023 Bottle. Cola-brown in colour with next to no head. This is an 8.5% version but still tastes mainly of alcohol, not much dark malt character gets through in this one. It is sweet though. UPDATED: OCT 14, 2022 Mainly dark chocolate and sweet coffee aroma. Similar taste, long sweetness, hints of plum and liquorice. UPDATED: MAR 27, 2022 (Bottle) Dark brown colour, almost black, with brief foamy head. Malty, roasted nose with notes of sweet espresso, chocolate, orange, black rye bread, liquorice and a touch of smoke. Malty, roasted taste with sweet espresso, orange chocolate, prunes, black bread, liquorice, a touch of tobacco and a balanced coffee bitterness in the finish. Almost full body, sweet. On the sweet side, but a really tasty and well made Baltic porter. Very nice.", "url": "https://www.ratebeer.com/Ratings/Beer/Beer-Ratings.asp?BeerID=116997", "category": "warmińsko-mazurskie", "sub_category": "Napoje (alkoholowe i bezalkoholowe) ", "phrase": "Porter warmiński"}
