{"meta_description": "", "title": "Biłgoraj pierogi - Wikipedia", "content": "Biłgoraj pieróg[citation needed] (Polish: Pieróg biłgorajski, piróg biłgorajski, krupniak) is a traditional Polish regional dish, originating from Biłgoraj Land, formerly prepared for important celebrations and holidays.[1] Pieróg biłgorajski is baked either without a crust - then it's called \"bald\" (pol. łysy) - or with a yeast dough crust. The filing is based on cooked potatoes, quark and cooked buckwheat groats (kasha).[1] The other ingredients are: eggs, śmietana (sour cream), fatback or lard, mint (fresh or dried) and spices (salt, black pepper).[1] The kneaded dough is formed into a rectangular or circular shape and baked in oven.[1] Optionally, pieróg biłgorajski can be folded in a thin layer of yeast-based dough.[2] The texture of the pieróg (sing.) is solid, easy to break or crumble, with its appearance resembling that of freshly cooked pâté.[2] May be served hot or cold, with śmietana (sour cream), milk or butter.[1] A Polish dish with a similar taste is kaszak, which is de facto a bread roll infilled with Biłgoraj pierogi. Since October 4, 2005 the Biłgoraj pierogi are found on the Polish Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development's List of Traditional Products [pl].[2]", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi%C5%82goraj_pierogi", "category": "lubelskie", "sub_category": "Wyroby piekarnicze i cukiernicze", "phrase": "Pieróg (Piróg) biłgorajski dawniej zwany „krupniakiem”"}
