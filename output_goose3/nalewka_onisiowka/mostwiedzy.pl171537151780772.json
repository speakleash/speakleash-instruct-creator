It is produced from multiflower honey, black elderberry flower syrup, and spirit. Due to fact that the “Onisiówka” nalewka liqueur has never been investigated, these studies are the foundation for further work on this regional alcoholic beverage. The main aim of this work is the authenticity assessment of the “Onisiówka” nalewka liqueurs by means of qualitative characteristics of volatile fraction and sensory evaluation. Tentative identification has been performed using two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC×GC-TOFMS). Application of GC×GC-TOFMS allowed for detection of around 350 compounds present in the volatile fraction of the “Onisiówka” from which 102 compounds were tentatively identified. PCA results showed that the first two principal components constitute 96.98% of total variance. Statistical analysis was used to visualize relations between tentatively identified compounds; therefore, it has been demonstrated that 23 chemical compounds may have significant influence on the overall flavor and taste of the “Onisiówka”. These substances belong to four chemical classes, in which the greatest number is represented by esters (13), aldehydes (6), alcohols (3), and one terpene compound. According to the sensory evaluation, the Onisiówka is characterized by sweet, honey, fruity, flowery, bitter, and spirituous flavor and taste.", "url": "https://mostwiedzy.pl/pl/publication/authenticity-assessment-of-the-onisiowka-nalewka-liqueurs-using-two-dimensional-gas-chromatography-a,138809-1", "category": "pomorskie", "sub_category": "Napoje (alkoholowe i bezalkoholowe)", "phrase": "Nalewka „onisiówka”"}
