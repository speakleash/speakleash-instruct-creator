{"meta_description": "The “Onisiówka” nalewka liqueur is a regional Polish alcoholic beverage, which is inscribed on the list of regional and traditional produc", "title": "Authenticity Assessment of the “Onisiówka” Nalewka Liqueurs Using Two-Dimensional Gas Chromatography and Sensory Evaluation - Food Analytical Methods", "content": "More than 350 compounds detected in each sample of the “Onisiówka” nalewka liqueur by GC×GC-TOFMS; 102 were tentatively identified with the following criteria: time of first dimension (1D) was set at 650 s, which was calculated on the basis of alkane mixtures, minimum of mass spectral similarity value set at 85%, S/N ratio set at 100, and the comparison of experimental and literature LTPRIs. Figure 2 shows a color plot obtained after HS-SPME/GC×GC-TOFMS analysis of the “Onisiówka” nalewka liqueur. The threshold value of similarity parameter was established at 850 (which means the 85% similarity of experimental mass spectrum with the mass spectrum taken from the database of NIST 2011). Values below mentioned threshold and signal-to-noise ratio were not taken into consideration during further data analysis. Regarding Fig. 3, the identification method of chemical compound, for example, nonanal, based on database of mass spectrum, was explained. The number of chromatographic peaks found resulted by S/N ratio established in this study (over 100). LTPRI experimental values were calculated according to the Van den Dool and Kratz equation (Van Den Dool and Kratz 1963). Additionally, values of LTPRI for compounds containing six atoms of carbon (C6) were extrapolated. The values of LTPRI were also compared with literature LTPRI for every compound. The acceptance criteria were less than 15 units of difference between experimental and literature LTPRI. Due to these requirements, 102 volatile compounds were tentatively identified in the Onisiówka nalewka liqueurs (Table 1). Among 102 tentatively identified compounds present in the volatile fraction of the “Onisiówka” nalewka liqueurs by GC×GC-TOFMS, esters were present in highest numbers (32), followed by aldehydes (21), terpenes (18), ketones (10), alcohols (11), acid (1), and others (9), which includes alkanes (1), furans (2), nitriles (1), and aromatic hydrocarbons (5). Percentage distribution of chemical classes present in the volatile fraction of the “Onisiówka” nalewka liqueurs was shown in Fig. 4. The greatest group by number of identified chemical compounds was esters. Esters were also characterized by the highest contribution in the volatile fraction of this beverage (Fig. 4). These compounds have major impact on the aroma profile of alcoholic beverages, and they influence flavor of final product. Generally, esters are mostly formed from estrification of fatty acids with alcohols during fermentation process (Christoph and Bauer-Christoph 2006). Ester content in alcoholic beverages is also affected by maceration process and sensory properties of ingredients such as fruits or herbs used for production. For this reason, a large amount of esters are identified in various alcohol beverages made from fruits, such as fruit spirits, wines, cognacs, and liqueurs (Nikićević et al. 2011; Welke et al. 2014b; Śliwińska et al. 2015). In general, esters of lower carboxylic acid and lower alcohols characterized with fruity sensory properties, for example, butyl acetate, ethyl pentanoate, ethyl hexanoate, hexyl acetate, ethyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, and ethyl octanoate. However, fatty acid esters like ethyl hexadecanoate contribute to waxy flavor (Jørgensen et al. 2000). Aldehydes, ketones, and alcohol are other large chemical groups of identified chemical compounds in the “Onisiówka”. According to Jørgensen et al. (2000) and Cajka et al. (2007) aldehydes, ketones, and alcohol represented major chemical groups of honey and elder flower volatile compounds. Most of them characterized fruity and floral flavor such as 3-methylbutanol, benzyl alcohol, 2-ethylhexanol, 1-octanol, 1-nonanol, hexanal, octanal, benzeneacetaldehyde, nonanal, 2-phenylpropenal, 2,4-nonadienal, decanal, 2-decenal, dodecanal, butylphenyl methylpropional, (E)-3-penten-2-one, 2-heptanone, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, acetophenone, 2-nonanone, 4-methylacetophenone, 2-decanone, 2-undecanone, 2-dodecanone, and 2-pentadecanone. Most of these compounds were previously identified in several studies of honey, elderberry fruits, and flowers (Jørgensen et al. 2000; Baroni et al. 2006; Pontes et al. 2007; Kaack 2008; Kaack and Christensen 2008; Ochmian et al. 2010; Rivellino et al. 2013; Dymerski et al. 2013; Vítová et al. 2015). Benzaldehyde and benzenealdehyde have been reported as usual components of unifloral honey (Baroni et al. 2006). Also, benzaldehyde previously has been detected as the most abundant aromatic compound in headspace of elderberry flower drink (Jørgensen et al. 2000). Benzyl alcohol and 2-phenylethanol have been identified and described as contributors to the flavor of elderberry (Mikova et al. 1984). Terpenes are another chemical compound group, which have influence on sensory properties of fruit spirit beverages and liqueurs (Christoph and Bauer-Christoph 2006; Winterová et al. 2008). In this study, 18 terpenes were identified; most of them may affect the pleasant fruity and herbaceous flavor of the “Onisiówka”. Terpenes such as (Z)-rose oxide, nerol oxide, and hotrienol are responsible for the characteristic floral aroma of elder flowers (Farkas et al. 1995; Jørgensen et al. 2000). In addition, other identified terpenes such as α-terpineol, terpinen-4-ol, terpinolene, nerol oxide, (Z)-linalool oxide, limonene, and 1,8-cineole have been also detected previously in honeys, elderberry fruits, and flowers (Jørgensen et al. 2000; Jensen et al. 2001; Cajka et al. 2007). There are several compounds which have been reported as common compounds of various honeys, such as toluene, furan, furfural, and hotrienol (Pontes et al. 2007). In the literature, there is information that phenol was identified in different samples of honey (Dymerski et al. 2013). Compounds such as β-damascone, 1,1,6-trimethyl-1,2-dihydronaphthalene (TDN), and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one have been also identified as contributor to elderberry flavors (Poll and Lewis 1986). Full sensory descriptions of all tentatively identified compounds in volatile fraction of the “Onisiówka” nalewka liqueur are, according to (AroChemBase library), described in Table 1. It may be noted that most of tentatively identified compounds originate from two main ingredients of this beverage: honey and elderberry flowers. It has been previously reported that honey and black elderberry flowers demonstrate antioxidant and health benefit properties (Malika et al. 2005; Thole et al. 2006; Charlebois 2007; Bertoncelj et al. 2007; Alzahrani et al. 2012; Sidor and Gramza-Michałowska 2015). It may be assumed that the “Onisiówka” nalewka liqueur has a positive impact on health. In order to visualize the relations between tentative identified compounds (102) in the volatile fractions of the “Onisiówka” nalewka liqueurs, PCA analysis was performed (Fig. 5). For this statistical analysis, area, height, and signal-to-noise ratio of peak of each compound were used. PCA results showed that the first two principal components accounted for 96.98% of total variance. In II and III quarts, there are 79 compounds in the negative area of PC1. These compounds could not be separated; they are located in a large cluster. It means that the values of used variables are similar compared to all tentatively identified compounds present in the volatile fraction of the “Onisiówka” nalewka liqueurs. On the other hand, 23 compounds are located in I and IV quarts in the positive region of PC1. These compounds may be defined. Also, as observed in Fig. 5, these compounds are located in two groups. The first group is located between 0 and 500,000 value of PC1 (in Fig. 5, highlighted in blue color). This group includes the following compounds: octanal, ethyl benzoate, dodecanal, hexyl salicylate, 1-dodecanol, 4-tert-butylcyclohexyl acetate, limonene, ethyl benzeneacetate, butyl acetate, diethyl butanedioate, and ethyl hexanoate. The second group (in Fig. 5, highlighted in red color) is located in a wider range of PC1 from 500,000 to 3,600,000 and includes ethyl decanoate, ethyl nonanoate, 2-ethylhexanol, benzaldehyde, ethyl tetradecanoate, decanal, ethyl dodecanoate, 2-phenylethanol, ethyl hexadecanoate, 2-furancarboxaldehyde, ethyl octanoate, and nonanal. The PCA has shown that these groups of compounds may significantly influence the overall flavor and taste of the “Onisiówka”. During sensory evaluation of the “Onisiówka” samples, panelist group evaluated color, flavor, and taste according to five-point scale, from 1 (bad) to 5 (very good). Results of this analysis were collected in Table 2. Additionally, panelists were asked to describe the color and the most perceptible flavors and tastes. According to the panelist group, color assessment of the “Onisiówka” received average score of 2.75, and they described it like honey, lemon chiffon, or straw. In addition, each member of the panelist group observed that evaluated samples had sediment. That color assessment of the Onisiówka may be due to occurring of natural sediment in this beverage, which can detract from the visual appearance of the product (Cernivec 2013). However, according to the panelist group, the “Onisiówka” received higher scores for flavor and taste assessments. Most of them also showed that they sensed sweet, honey, fruity, flower, and bitterness flavor. These sensory properties of the “Onisiówka” originate from several tentatively indentified compounds inter alia 2-phenylethanol, decanal, ethyl octanoate, butyl acetate, ethyl hexanoate, and nonanal. It should be noted that the last mentioned compounds were presented in PCA (Fig. 5) score as chemical compounds characterized by the highest value of peak area, height, and signal-to-noise ratio. Probably, the bitterness of “Onisiówka” originated from used black elderberry flower syrup. All members of the panelist group noticed that spirituous flavor felt very intense. This is due to the use of spirit rather than vodka which has less alcohol content.", "url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12161-016-0723-z", "category": "pomorskie", "sub_category": "Napoje (alkoholowe i bezalkoholowe)", "phrase": "Nalewka „onisiówka”"}
