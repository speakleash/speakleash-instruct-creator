Legend", "title": "Tatarczuch Bread - Arca del Gusto", "content": "A traditional bread made from buckwheat flour known as tatarczuch has been prepared for a very long time in the region around the town of Radomsko. Legend has it that the cultivation of buckwheat in the area of Stobiecka city, the current district of Radomsko, was initiated by the Tatar prisoners who settled there, hence the common name for the buckwheat: tatarka. The sale of porridge and baked buckwheat pancakes was the main source of income for the residents of Stobiecka during the sixteenth century, and that’s why women focused on the baking and selling of cakes in nearby markets and fairs.  Tatarczuch is baked on trays in traditional wood-burning brick ovens, which allows it to maintain the correct temperature, and gives a unique taste and aroma to the bread. A specific feature of this product is that it is prepared with whole grain buckwheat flour, which is rarely used for baking cakes. That’s why it has such a distinctive color and taste.  The knowledge and skills necessary to produce tatarczuch are passed down from generation to generation, but today, only a few producers know how to bake this product, and it is not widely commercially sold. It can be acquired in a few bakeries or during special occasions organized by the town hall. Tatarczuch can be eaten with butter and honey.", "url": "https://www.fondazioneslowfood.com/en/ark-of-taste-slow-food/tatarczuch-bread/", "category": "łódzkie", "sub_category": "Wyroby piekarnicze i cukiernicze", "phrase": "Tatarczuch z Radomska"}
