Cur the pineapple into stripes, scald the raisins with water, drain them and leave until they cool down, then drain them in spirit marinade and leave for the night. Scald the almonds, peel their skins and cut into small stripes. Mix the butter or cream it until light and fluffy and beat the eggs with sugar. Pour the dribble of beaten eggs slowly into the butter, continue to stir and add the spirit. Mix the chopped pineapple, raisins and almonds with the cream. Drain the coconut pies with pineapple juice and spread the pies with layers of cream from the smallest to the largest pie. Beat 1 30-36% double cream until it is stiff.
