These aspects were analysed in the lamb meat market as the example of the niche market in Poland. On the base of the results of the field researches one can state that the key determinants of respondents' attitudes and behaviours were the level of their knowledge about nutritional values of lamb products and the level of availability of these products. The negative opinions of others buyers were the main determinant of non buying of lamb products. It means that there are two big gaps (knowledge gap and availability gap) which should be filled by offerers to shape buyers' attitudes and behaviours in the effective way.", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/23085257/Tradycyjne_po%C5%BCywienie_i_potrawy_regionalne_Powi%C5%9Bla_Nasze_Pomorze_nr_15_2013_s_117_132", "category": "pomorskie", "sub_category": "Mięso świeże oraz produkty mięsne", "phrase": "Kiełbasa z Piekła z czarną gorczycą"}
