{"meta_description": "3 paintings intermixed; huge conduit sculpture, 300 needle dart feather \r\ninstallation", "title": "PoMaSta, TreeBoltNeuron, N>D>F — K.I.A.", "content": "3 paintings intermixed. Each separate painting has a central idea and image, and fully exists in a singular state. These paintings, and future works in this series, are getting combined over time, and with the new juxtapositions and different contexts, are accreting new meanings. (i.e. the Masai shield, when rearranged by columns, looks like a kimono... which, when intermixed with the Victorian era imagery & text re: proper female attire, found on the Polynesian mask, engenders new connections...) The three works in “PoMaSta”: First layer \"Polyvictorian\" (Polynesian mask + Victorian text/imagery, 8'x12'); Second \"Masaimatical\" (African shield + math formulae, 12'x5'); Third \"Staccatorest\" (musical glyph + historical/global musical notation, 6'x6') A 3D line-drawing in metal, media via Canadian Tire. A banyan tree, a lighting bolt, a dendrite-by-pipe. Like much of my work, it’s a larger piece composed of smaller rearrangeable component parts. With this sculpture I wanted to make something transformative out of everyday found (purchased) materials. Both the component-parts and everyday-materials usage stem from my collage sensibility. (Unplanned, the calligraphic silver branches of “TreeBoltNeuron” echo the arcs buffed into the aluminum in “StaccatoRest”, as well as the frottaged lines of “X-1 Papillons”.) Part of a future forest. A needle, a needle with feathers, feathers. All can be read as protection. All can be read as danger. It can be read from the bottom upwards as a movement towards enlightenment, or, or, or...more about it HERE. Part Two, with more artwork, including a hypersculpture, a Haida space shuttle and more, in the next post", "url": "https://www.nu4ya.com/blog-kia-art/pomasta-treeboltneuron-ngtdgtf", "category": "mazowieckie", "sub_category": "Mięso świeże oraz produkty mięsne", "phrase": "Pomasta"}
