Króluje w ni roztomajtość a wolność…”. O regionalnej specyfice deseru wigilijnego", "content": "In considering the aesthetics of gastronomy, one can focus on at least three distinct, though related, elements. First, the complex processes, experiences, and considerations (aims and criteria) in preparing food, which can also include the preparations for the presentation of food on the plate and table; second, the food objects themselves in terms of their qualities - not only the qualities they present to our various senses but also in terms of their larger social and symbolic meanings related to nutritional qualities; and third, the various processes involved in the consumption of the food. This third dimension of gastronomy, which concerns the ingestion of food, can be construed as the art of eating in the narrower, more specific sense (rather than its general sense of gastronomical art) and it is the focus of my paper. What distinguishes the mere act of eating from an art of eating? What qualities are demanded of the subject who practices eating as a refined art and what values does the art of eating serve? What are the different elements of the art of eating and what are the different ways in such art engages the somatic subject and requires somatic skill and sensitivity? How can somaesthetics contribute to a better understanding of the art of eating? My paper addresses the questions.", "url": "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/365825540_Moczka_jest_jak_Slask_Kroluje_w_ni_roztomajtosc_a_wolnosc_O_regionalnej_specyfice_deseru_wigilijnego", "category": "śląskie", "sub_category": "Gotowe dania i potrawy", "phrase": "Moczka / bryja"}
