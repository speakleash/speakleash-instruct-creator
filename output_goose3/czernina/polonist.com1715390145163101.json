It’s key ingredient is … blood. Mostly duck blood, but depending on the regional traditions, goose, hen, pig or rabbit vital fluids are used instead. For the full list of ingredients & detailed instructions, please see the recipe card at the end of this post. But before you scroll, there’s important stuff to know below. In this post we’re going to get familiar with this somewhat controversial soup and will cook one too! If you’re still hesitant to try this one, fry another Polish soup, for example: If you go through the oldest Polish cookbooks that survived the test of time, you’ll likely to notice an unusual dish – a soup called juszyca or czarnina/czernina. Its key ingredient? Blood, ideally duck or goose. Its distinctive sweet and sour taste is the hallmark of the traditional old-Polish cuisine. As in many other dishes of that time, acidity of blood and vinegar was balanced with the sweetness of dried fruit. Czernina couldn’t do without a dash of exotic spices, which, together with a contrasting sweet & sour combination, created a perfect flavour for noble old-Polish tastebuds. In 1682 Stanisław Czerniecki (chef of the Lubomirski princely family) described his methods of preparing czernina. His recipes collected in “Compendium Ferculorum” can be read till this day. If such a noble family enjoyed this soup, it couldn’t have been just a commoner’s dinner, right? Duck blood soup is a well loved dish in the regions of Greater Poland and Pomerania. At the same time, it’s quite known (but not necessarily eaten) all-over Poland. What propels one regional dish to fame while the others stay in relative obscurity? In case of czernina, if it isn’t familiar from our own home, then it’s from classic literature. The soup was briefly mentioned in the national epic of Poland “Pan Tadeusz” (“Sir Thaddeus”) written by Adam Mickiewicz. And since this epic poem is a compulsory read in every Polish school, most of us got familiar with czernina. Back in the day, over 200 years ago, if this soup was served to a young suitor trying to win a maiden’s hand, that could only mean one thing: a rejection. This theme shows up in “Pan Tadeusz” here: Do you need any special ingredients to make this Duck Blood Soup? Yes, you’ll need duck blood – fresh or frozen. 🇵🇱 Here in Poland, you’ll simply need to ask around at a farmers market. Usually, the blood won’t be immediately available at the butcher’s, but sometimes it can be ordered-in for a later purchase. Buy more blood in season (late Autumn) and then freeze for future use. 🌍 Outside of Poland, buying duck blood (fresh or frozen) can be a challenge, unless you are lucky enough to live by a duck farm. I called up a few butchers in the US (in various states). A meat-market keeper from Detroit told me that due to legal changes by the Department of Agriculture, they’re no longer allowed to sell raw animal products of this kind. I hear that it’s possible to get duck blood in some Polish Deli stores or Asian supermarkets / restaurants, you might want to give it a try.
