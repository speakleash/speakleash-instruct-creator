Many claim it’s all about the process of searching and time spent in the woods. But over the centuries, many Polish mushroom dishes have been invented, arguing it's the eating that's best. Here’s our selection. When you think of mushroom dishes, soup is probably the first thing that comes to mind – but it would actually be more accurate to use the plural form, since the recipes are endless. There are five in the famous 365 Obiadów (365 Dinners) by Lucyna Ćwierciakiewiczowa and four in the socialist classic Kuchnia Polska (Polish Cuisine). The versions best known across Poland are an intense, clear stock made with dried porcini (often eaten on New Year’s Eve instead of beetroot barszcz) and a creamy, thick soup made with fresh mushrooms. Still, there are more interesting variations, such as a traditional Christmas soup, made with dried mushrooms and fruits like prunes and pears, from the Kociewie region near Gdańsk. Zalewajka from central Poland is a potato soup similar to żurek, with mushrooms and bacon. Like peas and carrots, honey and lemon, or peanut butter and jelly: sauerkraut and mushrooms is the perfect combination, one absolutely essential to Polish cuisine. When you add different types of meat, prunes and spices, you get bigos (commonly known in English as hunter’s stew), while the simpler, vegetarian version is a Christmas Eve staple. It makes a glorious stuffing for paszteciki (little yeast buns), coulibiac (brioche or puff-pastry shell) and, obviously, pierogi, which we’ll discuss later on. When you add łazanki – small, square noodles – you get a delicious pasta dish, Polish style. According to legend, Jacek Odrowąż – Poland’s patron from the 13th century – stopped in Nockowa on his way to his mission in Kievan Rus’. He asked for some water and food: first, he saw wheat growing on the field, then cottage cheese on the sieve. With these, batter was made; then, he saw cabbage, which was chopped and boiled, as well as wild button mushrooms which, as he convinced the villagers, were not poisonous. Half of the pierogi were boiled and half baked, and the latter became the village’s specialty. The Pierogi Renaissance: How Poland's Most Famous Dish is Reinventing Itself Uszka (literally: little ears) are small dumplings which are usually served in clear beetroot barszcz for Christmas Eve (this version of barszcz is traditionally made with a stock of vegetables and dried mushrooms). They are similar to Italian tortellini, Russian/Ukrainian pelmeni and German Maultaschen. Yet, their closest cousins are the Jewish kreplach, which are also served in a soup – although it’s usually chicken broth – and also connected to festivities, as they are traditionally served on Rosh Hashanah. The filling is simple: dried boletuses are soaked in hot water and then mixed with fried onions and seasoned. The dough is made with just flour, hot water and salt (although some add a bit of butter or an egg). According to the dictionary, kotlet (from the French word côtelette) is an oval-shaped, flat side of either meat, fish or vegetables, which is then fried in fat. The best known Polish kotlety are schabowy (made with pork and crumbed like the Viennese schnitzel) and ground-pork mielony. Although most often associated with meat, there are long-standing vegetarian versions of kotlety – those made with mushrooms are among the best of all.", "url": "https://culture.pl/en/article/10-polish-mushroom-dishes-to-enjoy-this-fall", "category": "kujawsko-pomorskie", "sub_category": "Gotowe dania i potrawy", "phrase": "Grzybowniczki"}
