These miniature poppy seed wonders are crafted from basic, time-tested ingredients, echoing the resourcefulness of Lithuanians throughout history. Imagine golden spheres of delight, each a crunchy nod to the modest pantry staples that have graced Lithuanian Christmas Eve tables for generations. This traditional recipe uses yeast and takes about 3-4 hours from start to finish, so if you are looking for a quick version - head to our Quick Kūčiukai Recipe, which uses baking powder! Lithuanian Kūčiukai are delightful traditional poppy seed cookies (or more like mini breads) that hold a special place in Lithuanian culinary heritage, especially during the festive season. These one-bite treats are a cherished part of the Christmas Eve table, enjoyed as a symbolic and festive dish. It is speculated that these Christmas Eve biscuits symbolise the return of longer daylight, since Christmas Eve is the shortest day in Lithuania. Prepared with meticulous care, Kūčiukai are small, golden-brown dough balls enriched with poppy seeds. The process of making Kūčiukai involves a heartfelt tradition, with families coming together to shape and bake these miniature delights. Served with poppy seed milk or Cranberry Kissel, Kūčiukai embody the spirit of togetherness, tradition, and the joy of celebrating Christmas in Lithuania. Here's what you will need (find the quantities and full instructions in the recipe card at the bottom of the post): • all-purpose flour: can be replaced with strong bread flour. • milk: we use whole milk, but any milk (even plant-based will work). • poppy seeds: some variations of Lithuanian Christmas Eve Cookies use hemp seeds instead. • white sugar: regular granulated sugar or caster sugar (also known as superfine sugar) will work in this recipe. Do not use brown sugar, as it will muddle the colour and introduce too much moisture, making the end result too soft. • fast-action yeast: you may use fresh yeast. You will need 3x the weight of fresh yeast, so for 3.5g of dried yeast, use about 10-11g of fresh yeast. Warm the milk on low heat until it reaches 37-38° C (100° F) - it should be just warmer than your body temperature. Take it off the heat and stir in the sugar, yeast and oil. Add half of the flour, and mix well. Then cover the bowl with a tea towel or plastic wrap and leave the dough to proof in a warm spot for an hour, or until it doubles in volume. Once doubled, add the remaining flour and poppy seeds, and knead until you have a smooth and elastic dough. The dough should be sticky, so add a little more flour if needed. Grease a clean mixing bowl with a little oil, place your dough in it, cover it with plastic wrap or a damp kitchen towel and leave the dough for its second proof. The dough should, once again, double in volume. Preheat the oven to 180° C (350° F). Line a large baking sheet (or two) with baking parchment. Once the dough is ready, on a floured surface, roll the dough with the palms of your hands into a thin strand, measuring about 0.5cm (⅕ in) in diameter. Cut the strand into small pieces. Arrange Kūčiukai on the baking sheets, leaving a little space in between to allow them to rise. Bake them in the centre of the oven for 15 minutes. When done, you should have golden brown tops! Allow them to cool down on the baking sheet! Kūčiukai are best on the day that they are made, but, in reality, most Lithuanian families make them a day in advance. In Lithuania, the Christmas Eve table typically has 12 different dishes, so Christmas Eve is a busy day in the kitchen. Kūčiukai are served with poppy seed milk or Cranberry Kissel as a dessert for Christmas Eve dinner, and any leftovers are eaten as a snack the next day!
